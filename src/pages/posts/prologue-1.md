# Prologue

I am still thinking of things I want to accomplish with my personal website, so expect this list to keep growing during the creation process.

## Targets

Just about any knowledge I have acquired over the years that may sound interesting to you, I will try my best to share. I am far from the best person when it comes to journaling and blogging, but this might be the opportunity to change.

### To give

- **Tech tips:** These can include software that I normally use, GitHub repositories (currently Discord themes and Linux dotfiles) as well as any troubleshooting for problems that I have come across.
- **Cooking tips:** Something I want to focus on **the most**. Cooking has been and still remains an integral part of my daily life. Here I will likely post my cooking framework, including guides on ingredient choice, cooking methods etc.
- **Photography:** This is where I will likely share my **darktable LUTs** for those interested in color grading, along with guides on mobile photography. **Unsplash API** could also be used to display random images from my Unsplash collections.

### To learn

- **Language:** As I am currently studying in Germany, I want to use this website as a chance to learn the German language. The website, along with all posts will be written in both English and German. Note here that **the English version will be published first**, followed by the German version some time later.
- **Making a website:** Well, without a website nothing would be shared, right? So I would also like to brush up on some basic skills with these frameworks: **Astro, UnoCSS** (more along the way). The website source will be available over GitHub.
- **Writing skills:** I am terrible at writing as an engineering student, so don't expect to read Shakespare level literature.
