# Website layout

## Layout inspirations

- [Astro Paper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/) by satnaing
- [Microblog](https://microblog-theta.vercel.app/) by Lexington Themes
- [Typography](https://blog.moeyua.com/) by Moeyua

## Components

- Blog page with posts, categories and tags
- About page with short introduction social links
- Project page, mainly with GitHub projects
- A page dedicated to cooking stuff
- A page dedicated to photography using Unsplash API to display a random image from my collections
- A toggle to switch between the German and English language (need to figure out the backend for this)
- A toggle to switch between light and dark mode for easy viewing

_Note to self: Custom Markdown syntax in Obsidian will not work in regular Markdown mode_
